## Installation
Fork or Clone the project

Use the package manager npm to install the dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

## Features
1. Clean, minimalistic UI to reduce user's activation energy to start learning
2. Real time Body tracking along with a follow along video
3. Real time score to tell the user how the user is performing
4. A graph of how the user performed after completing each level
5. A download button for the user to download their dance after each level

### Calculation of the score
Movenet model detects 17 keypoints of the body such as nose, left elbow, right knee, etc.

For calculating the score, I have used the method of gradients (calculating the slope of the segments connecting the keypoints. ) because the gradient of the user will remain same for all video conditions, therefore the placement of the camera need not be considered.

The gradients in the dance video are pre-calculated and are compared to the gradients of the user in real time.
